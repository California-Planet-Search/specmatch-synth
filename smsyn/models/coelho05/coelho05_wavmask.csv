# This file specifies the regions of the Coelho 2005 models which we
# exclude from SpecMatch. We identified these regions by comparing the
# Coelho model of the solar spectrum and a spectrum of
# ganymede. Regions with errors in line parameters are excluded from
# the fit. They were originally measured in segments of spectrum
# corresponding to different HIRES orders. Thus there are gaps in the mask
